Big Mart Sales Prediction


Overview:

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model that predicts the sales of products at Big Mart stores. The goal is to estimate the sales of a product based on various features such as the product's attributes, store characteristics, and marketing details. This project can help retailers optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.


Features:

- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, performed data cleaning, and encoded categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data, which helped in understanding the factors influencing sales.
- Feature Engineering: Created new features such as product visibility, store type, and others to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Modeling: Experimented with different machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to find the best model for predicting sales.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination), and cross-validation scores.
- Deployment: Deployed the final model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application that predicts sales based on user input.


Installation:
